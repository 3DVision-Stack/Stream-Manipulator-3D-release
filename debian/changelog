  * Add some more Plugins:
    * Frustum Culling Filter Plugin
    Removes everything inside/outside a frustum,  defined by two aperture angles and
    two parallel planes.
    * Median Filter Plugin
    The  median filter  is  one of  the simplest  and  wide-spread image  processing
    filters. It is known to perform  well with "shot"/impulse noise (some individual
    pixels having extreme  values), it does not reduce contrast  across steps in the
    function  (as compared  to filters  based  on averaging),  and it  is robust  to
    outliers. Furthermore, it is simple to implement and efficient, as it requires a
    single pass over  the image. It consists  of a moving window of  fixed size that
    replaces the pixel in the center with the median inside the window.
    NOTE: This filters  only the depth (z-component) of  organized and untransformed
    (i.e., in  camera coordinates) point  clouds. An error  will be outputted  if an
    unorganized cloud is given.
    * PassThrough Filter Plugin
    PassThrough passes  points in a  cloud based  on constraints for  one particular
    field of the  point type. Iterates through the entire  input once, automatically
    filtering non-finite points and the points outside the interval specified by the
    filter limits, which applies only to the field specified by field type.
